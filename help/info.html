                    <h3>General Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        ReSync GUI is a Python Graphical User Interface (GUI) for synchronizing intracranial data from Deep Brain Stimulation 
                        (DBS) electrodes with external data. It is designed to be user-friendly and to facilitate the synchronization 
                        process. The GUI is built using the PyQt5 library and (should be) compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating 
                        systems. It is open-source and can be freely downloaded and modified by users.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Supported data formats:</h4> 
                    <p>
                        ReSync GUI synchronizes data from DBS electrodes ("intracranial data") with external data.<br>
                        The supported data formats are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>For the intracranial data: .mat<br>
                            The GUI is designed to be used on files preprocessed with the 
                            <a href="https://github.com/neuromodulation/perceive" target="_blank" class="clickable-link">perceive</a> toolbox.
                            This toolbox loads the .json file recovered from the clinician recording tablet after a recording session, 
                            and generates <a href="bids.neuroimaging.io/" target="_blank" class="clickable-link">BIDS-</a>inspired subject 
                            and session folders with the ieeg format specifier. All time series data are being exported as FieldTrip '.mat' files.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>For the external data: .xdf, .Poly5.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The .Poly5 format is the output format of <a href="https://www.tmsi.com/" target="_blank" class="clickable-link">TMSi</a> data recorder</li>
                                    <li>The .xdf format is the output format of <a href="https://labstreaminglayer.org/#/" target="_blank" class="clickable-link">Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)</a></li>
                                </ul>
                                
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Supported saving formats after synchronization:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The synchronized data can be saved in the following formats:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the input format was .Poly5:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>.mat</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>If the input format was .xdf:</li>
                            <ul>

                        <ol class="colored-numbers">

                                Open the GUI by running the command: <span class="code-text">python sync_gui_clean.py</span>
                            </li><br>

                                Load the intracranial data by clicking on the "Load Intracranial Data" button.

                            <li>
                                Load the external data by clicking on the "Load External Data" button.

                            <li>
                                For each data type, select the channel containing the synchronization artifacts. 
                                See <a href="#sync-protocol" class="clickable-link">the synchronization protocol</a> 
                                for more information about how to create the artifacts during the recording. 
                                You can plot the channel to make sure you see the artifacts.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                Detect the first artifact, either by using the automatic or the manual method. See on the <a href=#figure1>figure 1</a> below which sample should be detected as the start of the artifact for a reliable synchronization.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                Before saving, you can assess the "timeshift", i.e. you can plot the 
                                synchronized data together and verify if the last artifact is also aligned. 
                                Checking the timeshift is an important step to ensure that there was no data loss 
                                during the recording. 
                                <ul>
                                    <li> If the absolute value of the timeshift is higher than 150ms, it might be a good 
                                        idea to check for packet loss in the intracranial data. </li>
                                    <li> If the absolute value of the timeshift is smaller than 150ms, but still higher than 10ms 
                                        (see <a href=#figure2>figure 2</a> for an example), it might be a good idea to adjust the 
                                        effective sampling frequency of the intracranial data.</li>
                                    <li> IMPORTANT: do NOT adjust the sampling frequency if the timeshift is >150ms 
                                        because this is a sign of packet loss, not of inaccurate sampling frequency. 
                                        You should first look for where the missing packets of data are, replace them by NaNs, 
                                        then synchronize again and only then you can correct the sampling frequency.</li>
                                </ul>    
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To calculate the effective sampling frequency of the intracranial data, you can click on 
                                "Effective sampling frequency correction". In this window, both the intracranial and the 
                                external channels are plotted (see <a href=#figure3>figure 3</a> below for an example).
                                You have to detect manually the first and the last artifact in each channel (see 
                                <a href=#figure4>figure 4</a> below for an example).
                                The effective sampling frequency is calculated the number of samples between 
                                the two artifacts (in the intracranial signal) divided by the time difference between
                                the last and the first artifact (in the external signal). Once calculated, this "effective"
                                sampling frequency is automatically applied to the intracranial file. Please reselect the 
                                first artifact in the intracranial data in the home page to apply the correction before saving.
                                You can also plot the corrected data in the timeshift analysis window to check if the 
                                synchronization is correct.                      
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once the first artifact has been detected in both files, you can choose the fileformat 
                                in which you want to save the synchronized data (and a folder to save the results).

                        the timeshift is 36ms, which means that the sampling frequency of the intracranial data

                    <h3>Synchronization Protocol</h3>
                    <p>
                        The synchronization protocol is a set of guidelines to help you create synchronization artifacts 
                        during the recording. These artifacts are used later on to synchronize the intracranial data with the external data thanks to this GUI.
                        <h4>Steps:</h4>
                        <ol class="colored-numbers">
                            <li>
                                <b>Prepare the recording:</b> Setup the BrainSense Streaming mode. Deactivate the ramp option of the stimulation on the clinician recording tablet. 
                                Keep the stimulation ON, but set it at 0mA bilaterally.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Start the recording:</b> Start the recording of the intracranial data and the external data at the same time.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Generate the artifacts:</b> In the clinician recording tablet, increase the stimulation amplitude to 1mA

                                This will generate a clear artifact in the intracranial data, which will be used for synchronization. 
                                Try to always perform the artifact on the same side.
